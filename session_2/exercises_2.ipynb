    "When facing a spatial differential equation that we want to solve numerically, with spatial discretization methods we want to compute all values $f(x_0), ..., f(x_N)$ of a discretized function $f$ simultaneously. Spatial discretization methods are therefore opposed to temporal discretization methods for which the computation of $f(t_{i+1})$ relies on the previous values $f(t_0),..., f(t_i)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this TD we will not be interested yet in solving a spatial differential equation as we first need to get familiar with methods to approximate a function $f$, and we will focus here on **spectral methods**. We recall that spectral methods rely on the expansion of a function $f$ on a basis of functions $\\{\\phi_k\\}_k$ (in a function space we do not specify at this point). The coefficients of the expansion will be noted $\\hat{f}_k$. Thus we have:\n",
