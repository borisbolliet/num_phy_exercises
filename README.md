# Exercises of Numerical Physics

I [Bruno Regaldo Saint-Blancard] created this collection of exercises for a Master's level course in Numerical Physics at the École Normale Supérieure (Master 1 ICFP), where I served as a Teaching Assistant from 2018 to 2021. The course was led by [Professor Laurette Tuckerman](https://blog.espci.fr/laurette/).
